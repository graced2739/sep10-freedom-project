                    <div class="divfont fontcolor">This picture shows a way pollution is suspended and the effects of global warming. Pollution is caused by suspending carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxides and particulate matter into the air. These gases come from burning fosil fules, coal, oil and gasoline which emits the greenhouse effect causing global warming and the air around us to become toxic to breathe. When global warming happens the Earth gets warmer and warmer which causes the ice caps in the South and North poles to melt which will cause mass flooding. Even if mass flooding isn't occuring right now it still affects the animals living there;like the polar bear. </div>

                 <p class="font2 fontcolor fontfuture2">From recent technology we are able to use any carbon-based waste like turkey guts, used tires, cans etc. to turn them into oil. To turn these waste into oil they just have to go through a process called thermo-depolymerization.Thermo depolymerization is a depolymerization that uses hydrous pyrolysis (when organic compounds are heated to high temperatures) to reduce complex organic compounds into oil. According to people that developed this process, a ton of turkey waste can make 600 pounds of petroleum which can be used to produce oil.</p>

                <p class="font2 fontcolor">Plant your roof is where buildings have gardens on top of their roofs. These roofs help absorb heat, reduce carbon dioxide impact by taking up CO2 and giving off oxygen, absorbs stormwater and also reduces summer air conditioning usage. Having these garden roofs can lead to butterflies, songbirds and other organisms having a nice stable environment to live in. </p>

                <p class="font2 fontcolor">Bioremediation is the introduction of microorganisms and other forms of life that can consume and break down environmental pollutants. One example of this is the cleanup of nitrates in contaminated water with the help of microbes. Another example is using plants to uptake arsenic( a solid chemical element that is used in wood preservatives, alloys, and semiconductors and is extremely toxic) from contaminated soil. One example of this plant is the Arabidopsis. </p>
                <p class="font2 fontcolor">Most of the time, native plant species are used for site cleanup. This is beneficial as it doesn’t require pesticides or watering. Scientists are also trying to genetically modify plants to take up contaminants in their roots then transport the contaminants to their leaves in order to make harvesting easier.</p>

An invention that can help this problem is Nick Sheridon’s invention of the electronic paper.An electronic paper is a flexible display that looks a lot like real paper but can be reused again and again. The display contains microcapsules that are filled with particles that carry electric charges bonded to a steel foil. The black and white particles in the microcapsule are associated with either a positive or negative charge. Depending on which charge is applied, the black and white particles can display different patterns which are words, pictures etc. that you can see. </p>

A process called pyrolysis can help this problem. Pyrolysis uses heat and the absence of oxygen to reconvert plastic waste back into a liquid feedstock which can be directly used as fuel or converted to another fuel or energy product. This recycling process can also save us $55 billion by the next decade. </p>

                <p class="renewable2 font2 fontcolor">Renewable energy, also known as ‘clean energy’, is energy that is collected from renewable resources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Modern environmental technology has allowed us to capture this renewable energy and convert it into electricity or useful heat through devices such as solar panels, wind and water turbines. While many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to remote areas and developing countries, where energy is crucial for human development.The prices of renewable energy technologies like solar panels and wind turbines are also falling, meaning that governments are able to better invest in them rather than alternatives that use nonrenewable energy.</p>

                <p class="smart font2 fontcolor fontfuture2">First off, smart technology are devices like linking sensors and other appliances that are connected to the Internet of Things (IoT).These devices can then be remotely monitored and programmed in order to be as energy efficient as possible and respond to the needs of the users.</p>
                <p class="smart font2 fontcolor fontfuture">The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of internet-connected objects that are able to  collect and exchange data using embedded sensor technologies. This data allows devices in the network to ‘make decisions’ based on real-time information. For example, intelligent lighting systems only illuminate areas that require it and a smart thermostat keeps homes at certain temperatures during certain times of day, reducing wastage.</p>
                <p class="smart font2 fontcolor fontfuture">The technology of the internet demonstrates a positive impact of technology on the environment as social media is used to raise awareness of global issues. Experts from different fields can share their research, experience and ideas in order to come up with improved solutions that help our environments. In addition, traveling  is reduced since meetings/communication between friends and families can be done virtually, which reduces pollution from transport emissions.</p>

                <p class="ideap font2 fontcolor fontfuture">1. One of my ideas is the creation of machines that are able to make unrecyclable materials recyclable. These machines would be programmed to do specific things according to the material. There are actually many types of materials that aren’t recyclable such as brightly dyed papers, juice boxes and other coated cardboard drink containers which can also contain wax (some places accept them while some don’t), pizza boxes as they contain a lot of grease, takeout containers with food residues,, and etc. Here are my ideas for each of these materials:</p>
                <p class="ideapp font2 fontcolor fontfuture2">a. Brightly dyed papers: My idea for brightly dyed papers is that the machines would only recycle dyed paper of the same color and the same paper type so the dye wouldn’t bleed to other colored papers, especially white paper. </p>
                <img src="https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/paper.jpg" class="img-fluid imgp">

                <p class="ideappp font2 fontcolor fontfuture"> b. Cardboard drink containers coated with wax:  I want to see a way where machines are able to strip wax layers off cartons allowing these cartoons to be recyclable.</p>
                <p class="ideapppp font2 fontcolor">c. Greasy pizza boxes:  I want to see a machine that is able to clean grease off of cardboard allowing it to be recyclable or identify the parts that are too greasy, cut the greasy parts off and separate the clean and greasy parts. The clean parts can then be recycled.</p>
                <img src= "https://anicehome.com.au/wp-content/uploads/oily-pizza-boxes-recycling-768x401.jpg" class="img-fluid imgppp">
                <p class="ideappppp font2 fontcolor fontfuture2">d. Food containers containing food residues: Machines can just suck up those food which can actually be used for soil fertilizer, and if there is some oil left over the machines can clean it and maybe in the future there is a way to reuse this oil.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p class="idea2 font2 fontcolor fontfuture">2. My second idea  is an app where you can add your own ideas of diy projects that use materials you have around the house or any types of materials that are able to be reused. This is a great idea as you can do something fun while decreasing the amount of trash you throw away. First of all I think the app will provide some background information on common materials that can be reused and why it is important to reuse after you created an account . Then you can start to create a page of your project ideas or existing project ideas with a title, materials, a tutorial via writing or video that you can upload, some pictures, etc. You may like,comment, save people’s blogs to view later and follow along with people’s tutorials. There can be a search bar where you can search for project ideas that you like and want to see and the materials you have. There can also be add ons like different templates for the pages you want to create, some available fonts, colors, and sizes so you can be as creative as you want. There have already been many creative ideas that I have seen that use recyclable materials like plastic, paper, cardboard and more so I think it is a good idea to have an app that compiles all of them in the same area.</p>
