                    <div>This picture shows a way pollution is suspended and the effects of global warming. Pollution is caused by suspending carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxides and particulate matter into the air. These gases come from burning fosiil fukes, coal, oil and gasoline which emits the greenhouse effect causing global warming and the air around us to become toxic. When global warming happens the Earth gets warmer and warmer which causes the ice caps in the South and North poles to melt which will cause mass flooding. Even if mass flooding isn't occuring right now it still affects the animals living there. </div>

                 <h2>Making Oil from Just about Anything:</h2>
                 <p>From recent technology we are able to use any carbon-based waste like turkey guts, used tires, cans etc. to turn them into oil. To turn these waste into oil they just have to go through a process called thermo-depolymerization.Thermo depolymerization is a depolymerization that uses hydrous pyrolysis (when organic compounds are heated to high temperatures) to reduce complex organic compounds into oil. According to people that developed this process, a ton of turkey waste can make 600 pounds of petroleum which can be used to produce oil.</p>

                <p>Plant your roof is where buildings have gardens on top of their roofs. These roofs help absorb heat, reduce carbon dioxide impact by taking up CO2 and giving off oxygen, absorbs stormwater and also reduces summer air conditioning usage. Having these garden roofs can lead to butterflies, songbirds and other organisms having a nice stable environment to live in. </p>
